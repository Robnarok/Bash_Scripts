# Bash_Scripts

## Snipping

Its a short tool to make a Screenshot of an rectangular portion of the screen, (saves it in the /tmp/ folder) and copy it to the clipboard. 

Its not Perfect and i am pretty sure there is a tool out there which is way better, but it works for me

## Requirments
- Imagemagick (for the import command)
- xclip (To manipulate the Clipboard)
